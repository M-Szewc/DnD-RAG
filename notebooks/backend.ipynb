These elves could apparate with ease whereas it normally took wizards many years to master that craft. It is believed that this power led wizards to ultimately fear elves. History is a bit murky as to how this was accomplished, but all of the house elves were bought under servitude of the wizards. Thus their troubles began. Under their new rulers, the elves worked like slaves with little reprieve. They were heavily mistreated and any welfare laws passed held no enforcement.
